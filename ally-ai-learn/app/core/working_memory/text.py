"""Word extraction for the working memory. One implementation, three callers.

This exists because the same six lines were written three times — in `recall`
for cue matching, in `store` for `same_fact`, in `writeout` for the groundedness
check — and all three carried the same bug, so all three were broken in the same
languages at once.

**The bug, found by the multilingual v2v sweep on 2026-08-24.** The pattern was
`[\\w']+`, and Python's `\\w` does not match Indic combining vowel signs: they
are Unicode category Mn/Mc, which is not alphanumeric. So every Devanagari,
Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu word was SHREDDED at each matra —
"इसलिए" became "इसल" + "ए" — and the 4-character floor then deleted the
fragments. Measured on a Hindi sentence: 16 tokens, **zero** content words.

The consequences were silent and severe, and each one looked like a feature that
simply had nothing to say:

- `check_grounding` skips an item it cannot extract words from, so EVERY Indic
  disclosure vanished — not rejected as ungrounded, just gone — and
  `build_writeout` returned None. The entire semantic record was empty for every
  non-English session.
- `same_fact` compared empty sets, so reconsolidation never merged an Indic
  paraphrase and the ledger accumulated duplicates.
- Cue derivation produced nothing, so recall never responded to an Indic
  conversation, and the tier-2 fallback could not rescue it either.

This is the exact failure CLAUDE.md warns about: a fix verified in English tells
you very little about Malayalam, Tamil or Kannada.
